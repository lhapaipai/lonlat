# RLayer

This component wraps a MapLibre Layer object. He manages its life cycle and is
responsible for adding/removing it to the map. For this reason this component
must be a descendant of `RMap`.

The `id` and the `type` props are **readonly**. This allows us to manage
reactivity on the same instance throughout its lifecycle. In some cases you'll have
to add a `key` prop to maintain this state. see below [Error: RLayer id should not change](#error-rlayer-id-should-not-change).


## Usage

```tsx
import { RMap, RSource, RLayer } from "maplibre-react-components";

const townPaintStyle = {
  "fill-outline-color": "rgba(0,0,0,0.1)",
  "fill-color": "rgba(255,0,0,0.3)",
};

export default function App() {
  return (
    <RMap>
      <RSource id="thyez" type="geojson" data="/data/thyez.geojson" />
      <RLayer
        source="thyez"
        id="thyez-fill"
        type="fill"
        paint={townPaintStyle}
      />
    </RMap>
  );
};
```

## Reactivity

Some props are reactives. Here is the complete list, it applies depending on whether or not the layer
has this prop in its options.

```ts
type LayerReactiveOptions = {
  layout?: any;
  paint?: any;
  filter?: FilterSpecification;
  minzoom?: number;
  maxzoom?: number;
  beforeId?: string;
}
```

Be careful to define stable objects for `layout`, `paint` and `filter` props to avoid multiplying renderings.

import LayoutPaint from "./LayoutPaint.tsx";
import layoutPaintCode from "./LayoutPaint.extract.tsx?code";

<TwoCols first={<ShikiContent html={layoutPaintCode} />} second={<LayoutPaint />} />

## Error: RLayer id should not change.

When you have conditional renderers within your `RMap` component you will need to set the
prop `key` for your `RLayer` to help React maintain its association with the correct component.

Consider `id` prop for MapLibre mapping and `key` prop for React mapping. If you want to know
why see [Tips: key vs id](/tips#error-id-should-not-change-key-vs-id).


## Reference

`RLayer` accept same props as `Layer` options plus `beforeId`.

```tsx
type RLayerProps = LayerOptions & {
  beforeId?: string;
};

type LayerOptions = LayerSpecification | CustomLayerInterface;
```
